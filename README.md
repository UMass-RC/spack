Tutorial
----------------

We maintain a
[**hands-on tutorial**](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html).
It covers basic to advanced usage, packaging, developer features, and large HPC
deployments.  You can do all of the exercises on your own laptop using a
Docker container.

Feel free to use these materials to teach users at your organization
about Spack.

Community
------------------------

Spack is an open source project.  Questions, discussion, and
contributions are welcome. Contributions can be anything from new
packages to bugfixes, documentation, or even new core features.

Contributing
------------------------
Contributing to Spack is relatively easy.  Just send us a
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
When you send your request, make ``develop`` the destination branch on the
[Spack repository](https://github.com/spack/spack).

Your PR must pass Spack's unit tests and documentation tests, and must be
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant.  We enforce
these guidelines with our CI process. To run these tests locally, and for
helpful tips on git, see our
[Contribution Guide](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contribution_guide.html).

Spack's `develop` branch has the latest contributions. Pull requests
should target `develop`, and users who want the latest package versions,
features, etc. can use `develop`.

Releases
--------

For multi-user site deployments or other use cases that need very stable
software installations, we recommend using Spack's
[stable releases](https://github.com/spack/spack/releases).

Each Spack release series also has a corresponding branch, e.g.
`releases/v0.14` has `0.14.x` versions of Spack, and `releases/v0.13` has
`0.13.x` versions. We backport important bug fixes to these branches but
we do not advance the package versions or make other changes that would
change the way Spack concretizes dependencies within a release branch.
So, you can base your Spack deployment on a release branch and `git pull`
to get fixes, without the package churn that comes with `develop`.

The latest release is always available with the `releases/latest` tag.

See the [docs on releases](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide.html#releases)
for more details.
